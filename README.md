# BudgetBuddy
This project was created as the semester long project sequence for GUI II at University of Massachusetts Lowell.
In this project, I was solely responsible for both the back end development and the deployment of the application, as well as some front end work when
other group members needed help (as I was the only one with prior experience in React and full stack development in general).
# Capabilities
BudgetBuddy can:
- Create an account (and sign in/out)
- Set your balance
- Log transactions
- Set your budget
- Update your budget and balance automatically as more transcations are added
- Show a graphic breakdown of income and spending according to added transactions
